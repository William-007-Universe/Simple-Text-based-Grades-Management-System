In this project, you will implement a system to manage student grades using Python. The system will create a predefined list of students, each with a random selection of subjects, and you’ll be able to perform the following operations:

Add a student record
Update a student's grade for a specific subject
Delete a student record
Display all student records and calculate average grades for each student and for each subject across students
Save and load the data from a JSON file
Helper Function: Generate Sample Dataset
This function will create a complex dataset of students with predefined names and a random selection of subjects with grades. Each student’s name is a key in the students dictionary, and grades are stored in a nested dictionary.
